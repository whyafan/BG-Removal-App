- We created a page in /pages directory for every Figma page in the design.
- We will now set up React Router in main.jsx.
- Currently creating the routes and testing them.
- Migrating from Pages -> App Router once project is done will be the priority.
- Convert this into modern HTML and other coding-related practices including JS -> TS
- Since we want the NavBar on every page, we mount the component to App.JSX, so that it applies to every page.
- I also want to note that we're not writing code in App.JSX for even the NavBar, which is the common in every page. We're leveraging the concept of components and relying on them for the same. Code remains more organized and readable that way.
- After a specific milestone, keep asking Cursor AI, the things we can improve in the code, and the way we can keep making it more modern, standard, and more, things I haven't already learned. We'll do the first iteration of this once Home.jsx is complete, both front-end and back-end.
- What's inline-flex?
- I can also improve the UI of this website as we move forward, add more to it using AI like the PERN video said. I'll follow his approach, see what stack he uses, and build something out that way too. URL to reference: https://youtu.be/ek7hmv5PVV8?si=CM2vgaxZSKpYXDNH
- Make the website more responsive.
- I'll do one page with him, and then I'll build the remaining front-end pages on my own.
